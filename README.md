# FoodCRUDify

A Food Delivery MERN App designed to streamline the process of ordering food online. This application demonstrates the implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to manage various aspects of the platform. Users can browse through a diverse menu, add items to their cart, and place orders. The app leverages the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) to provide a seamless user experience and robust backend support.

This project showcases full-stack development skills, including frontend development with React, backend development with Node.js and Express, and database management with MongoDB.
